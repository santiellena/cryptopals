# Cryptopals in Rust lang

This are my solutions to the [the cryptopals crypto challenges](https://www.cryptopals.com/).

Take into account that all the solutions are written in pure Rust, and this is my (almost) first time coding in this lang. 
If you feel that my solutions are not optimized or have errors, feel free to send a pull request or open an issue. I'll be more than glad to receive them ðŸ˜ƒ.


## Setup

As this whole set of solutions is written in Rust, you will need to have Rust installed.

To install `rustup` the command needed to install the whole Rust suit, run:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Then just run:

```bash
rustup
```

## How to Run

I've tried to keep this part as simple as possible, so in the `/src/main.rs` file, all the challenges are reproduced.

Just run:

```bash
 cargo run
```

And you will see all the logs from the programs!!

## Notes

Most of the notes and documentation are present in the code.
